# nodejs-readme-generator

## Application Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions.

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4). This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

I was given the below User Story and Acceptance Criteria:

Acceptance Criteria:

## Required modules / packages:

* Inquirer package
* Node.js fs module

## Module.exports: 

Module.exports was also used in the generateMarkdown.js so the generateMarkdown function can be called from index.js

generateMarkdown.js:
```
module.exports = generateMarkdown;
```
index.js:
```
const generateMarkdown = require('./utils/generateMarkdown.js')
```
